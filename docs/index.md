## Introduction and Overview

### [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
To start, we first need to understand what Django is. Django is the most popular web framework in the Python ecosystem, characterized by its high-level structure that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It has been constructed by experienced developers and aims to mitigate the hassles of web development; this allows developers to focus their attention on writing their app without feeling the need to reinvent the wheel. Django is a free and open-source framework that is ingrained in the model-template-views architectural pattern. Its maintenance is overseen by the Django Software Foundation, an independent, non-profit organization based in the United States.

### [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
The Django Rest Framework is a powerful library constructed on top of Django, with a unique interlinking to the Django Model. This relationship endows Django with the enhanced ability to create APIs(application programming interfaces).

An important thing to know about Django is how the information usually flows

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram 
    participant B as Browser
    participant DS as Django Server
    participant UP as URL Patterns 
    participant V as View
    
    B->>DS: Sends HTTP request 
    DS->>UP: Matches HTTP request to URL patterns
    UP->>V: Calls appropriate View with request object 
    V-->>UP: Response object
    UP-->>DS: Returns HTTP response
    DS-->>B: JSON response(in our case)
```

The sequence diagram illustrates the flow of an HTTP request through the Django web framework. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Browser Sends HTTP Request:** The process begins when the user interacts with the browser, triggering an HTTP request. This request is sent to the Django server.

2. **Django Server Receives Request:** Upon receiving the request, the Django server forwards it to the URL dispatcher (URL Patterns) to determine which view function should handle it.

3. **URL Patterns Match Request to View:** The URL dispatcher matches the incoming HTTP request to the appropriate view function based on the URL patterns defined in the Django project. It then calls the corresponding view function, passing along the request object.

4. **View Processes Request:** The view function performs the necessary processing based on the request received. This could involve querying the database, performing business logic, or any other required tasks. Once the processing is complete, the view returns a response object.

5. **Response Travels Back:** The response object generated by the view function travels back through the same path it came from, starting with the URL dispatcher. The response is passed back to the Django server.

6. **HTTP Response Returned:** The Django server sends the HTTP response, typically in the form of JSON data in your case, back to the browser, fulfilling the original request.

This sequence outlines the typical flow of a request-response cycle in Django, demonstrating how requests are handled and responses are generated within the framework.

## Set up the project

Now we have a basic understanding of Django and DRF. We are going to set up the project.

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:lipemorais/building-your-first-api-with-django-and-django-rest-framework.git
```

This will clone the repository

## Creating the music Django App

Now we are going to create the Django we are going to use in this tutorial.

```shell
cd first_api
./manage.py startapp music
```

This will create the app structure for us. Something similar to this below:
```shell
❯ tree .
.
├── db.sqlite3
├── first_api
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── asgi.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
├── manage.py
└── music
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── admin.py
    ├── apps.py
    ├── migrations
    │   └── __init__.py
    ├── models.py
    ├── tests.py
    └── views.py
```

Don't forget to add the app music to your INSTALLED_APPS in your `settings.py`
```python
# settings.py
...
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
    "rest_framework",
    "music",
]
...
```
## Django Models

Now the next step is create the models we are going to use in our API to represent the domain models.

We are going to create 3 models in the file models.py

1. Artist
2. Album
3. Song

Let's start with the artist model.

```python
# music.models.py
class Artist(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

Don't forget to import the models
```python
from django.db import models
```
Now the album model
```python
# music.models.py
class Album(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    artist = models.ForeignKey(Artist, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    release_year = models.IntegerField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

The last model will be the song model that will have relationship with artist and album.

```python
# music.models.py
class Song(models.Model):
    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    artist = models.ForeignKey(Artist, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  # Artist or band name
    album = models.ForeignKey(Album, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  # Album the song belongs to
    duration = models.IntegerField()  # Duration of the song in seconds
```

## URL Mapping and Views

Now let's go to the URL Mapping, we need to associate the url with the handler functions that are called as view in Django. To create a simple endpoint that works.


```python
# first_api.urls.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    path("", include('music.urls')),
]
```

You need to create a file `urls.py` inside music folder and make it look like the example below.

```python
# music.urls.py
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index')
]
```

And last but not least you need to create this
you need to create the view. A function view in this case.

```python
# music.views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse


def index(_request):
    return HttpResponse("My first API!")
```

So no you can use the command `task r` to start our django server, so you can access http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see it.
